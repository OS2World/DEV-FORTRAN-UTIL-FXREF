      READ-ME FILE FOR PROGRAM FXREF

      1. Purpose

         FXREF is a program to create cross reference listings of
         FORTRAN 77 programs for printing on a printer that can
         print:

         A. Text files containing carriage control characters as the
            first character of each print line.

         B. Postscript files

         FORTRAN 90 and FORTRAN 95 programs are NOT processed by this
         program.  All input source code to be processed must be in
         standard fixed form records not exceeding 132 columns per
         record.

      2. FILES IN THIS DISTRIBUTION

         The following files are included in this distribution:

         README.TXT
         FXREF.EXE
         FXREF.FOR
         FXREF.PS
         FXREFDOC.PS
         FXREFDOC.TXT
         LICENSE.TXT

         A. FXREF.EXE is the execution module for OS/2 versions 3
            through 4 and eComStation versions 1.0 through 2.0.  The
            directory where FXREF.EXE is located must have sufficient
            disk space to accommodate disk work files.  Work disk
            files' sizes are dependent on the size of the program being
            analyzed.  This execution file was generated by the open
            WATCOM FORTRAN compiler Ver. 1.9.

         B. The file FXREF.FOR is the FORTRAN 77 source code.

         C. FXREFDOC.TXT, and FXREFDOC.PS are documentation files for
            FXREF.

            FXREFDOC.TXT is a text file that can be printed or viewed
            on the computer monitor using an editor program.  No printer
            page control characters are present in this file.

            FXREFDOC.PS is a Postscript file that can be printed on any
            Postscript printer.  Page control is provided in this file.
            To view this file on the computer monitor, use the GHOST-
            SCRIPT program for OS/2 - EcomStation or other operating
            system available at the University of Wisconsin site:

                  WWW.CS.WISC.EDU/~GHOST.

            Except for a table of contents in FXREFDOC.PS, the two files
            contain identical text whether printed or viewed on the
            monitor.

         D. FXREF.PS is the Postscript listing of FXREF.FOR produced by
            FXREF.EXE.  Page control is provided in this file.
